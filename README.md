### IONIZTOL
Finds the wavelength of light that has a certain ionization energy OR ionization energy of a certain wavelength of light. Shows Formulas and Units for calculations.

### LAWOFCOS
Finds the missing angle or side in a Law of Cosines scenario.

**Note: Angle is determined based on radian/degree mode of calculator.**

### LAWOFSIN
Finds the missing angle or side in a Law of Sines scenario. Considers ambigious SSA case.

**Note: Input Angles are always considered as degrees. Output Angles are determined based on radian/degree mode of calculator.**

### MOLRMASS
Finds the molar mass of any compound given chemical formula. Prompts for a string of the chemical formula like "O2" or "C1O2". A number needs to be put after each element so H2O would be entered as "H2O1". Supports structural and molecular chemical formulas. Does not support parentheses.

### NUCLTIDE
Identifies whether RNA or DNA, Purine or Pyramidimine, and Nitrogenous Base (Adenine, Thymine, Uracil, Guanine, Cytosine).

### NUMTOELM
Helper Program to get element symbol from atomic number.

### OGIVE
Plots ogives and Analyzes their intersections based on x-axis or frequency. Can plot both relative and absolute frequency based on situation. X Data in L1 and Frequency Data in L2.

### PACMAN
Open-Source Release of classic game Pacman.

### PARAPONT
Find last point of a parallelogram given the other 3 points.

### PED
Calculates the Price Elasticity of Demand (PED). Can be used to calculate Price Elasticity of Supply (PES) using the same formula.

### PORTAL
Open-Source Release of Portal.

### PRMETEST
Simple implementation of a Miller-Rabin Primality Algorithm (Limited).

### PRMNSTAT
Simple program that displays the permutations formula and calculates a specific permuation(same result as nPr).

### PRPNDLN
Find line perpendicular to a certain line (including horizontal and vertical lines).

### PYTHAGFN
Finds leg or hypotenuse of a right triangle using Pythagorean Theorem.

### QUADFORM
